2011-08-26 Rodney J. Dyer <rjdyer@vcu.edu> version = 0.02
- [FIX] Vignette names (popgraph was coming out as genetic structure) and new vignettes for the offspring analysis
- [ADD] option 'verbose' for genetic.structure to toggle printing of progress for longer jobs.
- [NEW] great.circle.distance() and stratum.distance() functions added to calculate physical separation amongst
	sites.
- [NEW] google.pie.chart() function to make pie icons for population plotting
- [NEW] pies.on.map() function to create KML file for examining allele frequencies of strata
- [CHANGE] population.graph() added routines to incorporate latitude, longitude, and grouping 
	into the graph representation for spatial plotting.
- [NEW] popgraph.on.map() function to create KML file for population graphs
- [NEW] genetic.diversity() function to estimate diversity statistics using rarefaction.
- [NEW] Vignette on genetic.diversity
- [NEW] Vignette on mapping 'GStudio Mapping'
- [NEW] stratum.distance() function to get physical distances between populations.

UPCOMING:
- [ADD] Congruence of topologies for population graphs
- [ADD] as.html option for mapping functions to create googlemap javascript maps instead of kml files.
- [ADD] Example of amova in genetic.structure
- [ADD] Fst (coalescent time) added to genetic.structure
- [ADD] add drop.one option to multivariate.loci option
