gstudio 1.0 
-----------------

* This is a complete rewrite of the gstudio (ver. 0.X) package.  What I have done is to remake
  the fundamental locus object as an S3 object rather than an S4 class. 
* Too much has changed to interate through all of the changes.  To get a good idea of how to 
  use the new functionality see http://dyerlab.github.io/gstudio/
* Integrated, where possible, spatial connections to both the raster and sp packages such that 
  direct analyses of spatial population genetic processes can be accessed.
* This first version has the following functional components.
    - locus(), alleles(), frequencies()
    - heterozygosity in terms of He(), Fis(), Ho()
    - genetic_diversity() for parameters Ae(), A(), A95() with rarefaction()
    - genetic_distance() for dist_amova(), dist_bray(), dist_euclidean(), dist_cgd(), dist_nei(), dist_jaccard(), dist_Dps()
    - genetic_structure() for Gst(), Gst_prime(), and Dest()
    - spatial plotting and mapping using sp, raster, and google_maps API's
    - paternity() with transition_probability() for both strict and fractional paternity.
    - parent offspring stuff with with minus_mom()
    - added make_population() and mate() for making random populations
